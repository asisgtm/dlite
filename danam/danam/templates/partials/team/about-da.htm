                        David C. Andolfatto studied Asian archaeology at Marc Bloch University, Strasbourg (BA) and at
                        Paris Sorbonne University (MA and PhD). His research focuses on the archaeology, history and art
                        history of Nepal, especially in the Kathmandu Valley and in West Nepal. <br>
                        From 2015 to 2018, Andolfatto worked as a consultant for the UNESCO Kathmandu Office. During
                        this period, he conducted archaeological excavations on heritage sites and coordinated different
                        preservation projects. <br>
                        His PhD thesis on the archaeology of West Nepal led him to document historical sites and
                        artefacts in this largely overlooked part of the country. As a part of NHDP, Andolfatto
                        provides data on heritage sites of the area comprised between Jumla and the Mahakali river
                        (Nepal-India border).
