                                        Dhũllā Sataḥ used to stand at the three-way intersection in the center of the
                                        Dhũllā Ṭola. The Sataḥ partly collapsed in the 2015 earthquakes and its
                                        superstructure was dismantled shortly thereafter. Today only remnants of the
                                        foundation plinth and a few carved base stones representing lions remain on the
                                        overgrown site. The salvaged wood elements of the Sataḥ, which include columns,
                                        capitals and window frames, are stored in a metal shed nearby.
                                        The earliest images of the rest house taken by Werner Jacobsen in the 1950s show
                                        the building in its original configuration: Four carvings of Garuḍa can be seen
                                        attached to the centers of the capitals and nine carved wooden statues of
                                        unidentified deities are installed on the front face of the main beam. By 2014
                                        all these statues had disappeared.

                                        The historic trade route linking Kathmandu with Tibet used to cross through
                                        Sankhu. Horse caravans laden with goods often stopped there for an overnight
                                        stay. The traders were allowed to use the Dhũllā Sataḥ for accommodation and
                                        the horses were tied to large stones in front of the Sataḥ. Such stones with
                                        holes in them can still be seen there.

                                        A guthi related to the Dhũllā Sataḥ is still in operation. The members of the
                                        Guthi claim that their ancestor, Jaya Śaṅkara, built the Sataḥ some 400 years
                                        ago. There is no other information available regarding Dhũllā Sataḥ's age but
                                        the patterns and designs of woodcarvings also suggest a construction date in the
                                        late 17th century. Jaya Śaṅkara belonged to the influential Mehera Śreṣṭha clan
                                        that was responsible for the construction of many monuments in Sankhu. A record
                                        book of 1916 states the Guthi's responsibility for taking care of the Dhũllā
                                        Sataḥ and renovating it when required. Elders recall a portion of the Sataḥ’s
                                        roof collapsing in the 1934 earthquake. At that time Guthi members managed to
                                        carry out repairs within only a few months.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">
                                        In those days the Guthi received income from landholdings that made regular
                                        repairs and maintenance of the building possible. However, since this land is no
                                        longer under the Guthi's ownership it has been become difficult to raise the
                                        necessary funds. The failure in arranging a regular income for the timely
                                        maintenance of the Sataḥ coupled with most of the Guthi members moving out of
                                        Sankhu had left the rest house in a state of disrepair.
                                        Around 2010 a portion of the roof collapsed and parts of the central window fell
                                        off. It wasn't till mid-2012 that the Guthi covered the damaged portion of the
                                        roof with corrugated metal sheets, but unfortunately, the windows were never
                                        repaired. Despite the Sataḥ's importance and high artistic value no more efforts
                                        went into maintenance and its condition deteriorated further, resulting finally
                                        in its collapse. Following the dismantling of the Sataḥ in 2015, the Department
                                        of Archaeology initiated the administrative process for the reconstruction.
                                        However, this effort was abandoned due to a dispute over the Sataḥ’s ownership.
                                        Because the Sataḥ was never put in proper public ownership, now private
                                        individuals are claiming ownership so that they can use the land.

                                        The symmetrical facade features a three-bay opening in the center and is flanked
                                        by two doors on either side. The central opening likely once had the same carved
                                        wooden arches that survive on the side doors but might have been removed to fit
                                        the new doors for the shops. The relief of marching soldiers covers the entire
                                        width of the building. Similar figures of armed soldiers, carved on a timber
                                        corniche, have been documented at the Gārada Ghara in Nuwakot.

                                        The first floor is divided by pillars into seven bays. The design of the pillars
                                        has its precedent in the 18th century palaces of Gorkha and Nuwakot. Each bay is
                                        closed off by a window consisting of two shutters, each dived into six glass
                                        panes. The circular arch above the windows is framed by carved wood panels
                                        depicting foliage. Such unique window designs are extremely rare in the
                                        Kathmandu Valley. Similar windows survive in a private house in Kva Hiti,
                                        Kathmandu and are documented in a painting of the Basantapur Palace by Ambrose

                                        The Platoon House has been the source of much speculation and interesting oral
                                        historic accounts. The site and an older house originally belonged to Bhājudeva
                                        Brāhmaṇa, the priest of Jayaprakāśa Malla, the last Malla king of Kathmandu.
                                        Following the Gorkhalis' conquest of the Kathmandu Valley, the second Śāha king
                                        Pratāpa Siṃha gave the house and surrounding land to Abhimāna Siṃha Basnyāta as
                                        a land grant. Abhimāna Siṃha Basnyāta was a prominent noble in the court of King
                                        Pṛthvī Nārāyaṇa Śāha and contributed to the consolidation of the Gorkha kingdom.
                                        Abhimāna Siṃha is said to have begun with the construction of the Palṭana House
                                        three days after the ownership of the land was transferred to him in 1777 CE. An
                                        inscription, formerly installed at Nārāyaṇa Cuka the courtyard behind Palṭana
                                        Ghara, now lost, states that the building was completed on January 10, 1777 CE
                                        (Śaka Era 1698). The inscription further records Palṭana Ghara to be "a building
                                        with the protection of a line of tilaṅgās (army men) and rich in honor and
                                        wealth.

                                        The building is currently rented to a number of businesses that use the ground
                                        floor for shops and the upstairs for storage. Tilaṅgā Āyurvedālaya, an Ayurveda
                                        pharmacy, operates from one bay on the ground floor. The Vaidya family who runs
                                        the pharmacy claims that their ancestor, the Royal Vaidya (Ayurveda physician)
                                        opened the pharmacy at the request of King Pratāpa Siṃha Śāha in 1776 CE.

                                        When the Basnyāta clan tried to sell the building in 1961 CE, the pharmacy's
                                        owner filed a complaint with the palace and the sale was averted. The Palṭana
                                        Ghara has survived in almost original condition without any major alterations
                                        except for the modified roof. However, its dilapidated condition urgently
                                        requires repairs.

                                        Located in Thamel, Kathmandu, the Thã Bahī,is one of the oldest Buddhist
                                        monasteries in the Kathmandu Valley. A gold-plated statue of Maitreya exhibiting
                                        the bhaviṣyavyākaraṇamudrā is enshrined as the gandhurī-devatā (main deity) of
                                        the Bahī. The locals worship him as Siṃhasārthabāhu. There is another sanctum in
                                        the southern side of the Bahī's courtyard. A north-facing image of Amitābha is

                                        monastery that has two separate sanctums. The Bahī courtyard also contains four

                                        Dissimilar to most of the monasteries of the Valley, this Bahī belongs to the
                                        Pradhāna clans, but not to any Vajrācārya or Śākya clans. A legend popular among
                                        the Newars about the formation of this Bahī narrates that it was initially
                                        established in Sāmākhusi. Later, a flood destroyed the monastery, and a trader
                                        named Siṃhasārthabāhu returned from his trading voyage to Tibet and dismantled
                                        his own house to reconstruct the Bahī where it stands now. Therefore, the
                                        Pradhānas of the Thã Bahī revere Siṃhasārthabāhu as their ancestor and worship
                                        him as a deity. However, the Tibetan sources credit Atiśā Dīpaṅkara Śrījñāna
                                        for the construction of this Bahī. While he travelled from India to Tibet, the
                                        king of the Nepāla Valley had welcomed and received him at his palace in 1041
                                        CE. The king built a monastery as per the instructions of Atiśā, which then came
                                        to be known as Thama Vihāra (Thã Bahī). However, the Tibetan sources mention
                                        that there already were remnants of a foundation of a bahī that was hundreds of
                                        years old when Atiśā came here. Therefore, it appears Atiśā only reconstructed
                                        this monastery. Dharmasvāmī, a Tibetan monk who lived in Nepal for eight years
                                        from 1226 CE-1234 CE, had also visited the Thã Bahī. King Mukundasena of Pālpā
                                        had attacked the Bahī during his invasion of the Kathmandu Valley in NS 646
                                        (1526 CE).

                                        Thã Bahī used to have plenty of real property that yielded sufficient income
                                        for maintaining the monastery and carrying out religious, rituals and cultural
                                        activities. Unfortunately, the Bahī’s income decreased drastically, as most of
                                        the property have been privatized. A large stretch of land at Sāmākhusi and
                                        Manamayju were transferred to individuals, and only very few plots of land now
                                        remain in under the Bahī’s possession. The lotus pond in front of the Bahī
                                        complex was destroyed and encroached upon by a business complex. Therefore, a
                                        court case is pending at the Supreme Court.

                                        Lāykū Phalcā (lit. the phalcā at the palace) is a two-storeyed long 'L' shaped
                                        Phalcā occupying a large space right in front of Phasi Degaḥ (BKT0012) at the
                                        Bhaktapur Durbar Square. It has 27 bays facing north and 13 bays facing west
                                        while there are three more bays each on three other sides, making it a 49-bay
                                        Phalcā altogether and probably one of the longest arcaded platforms in Nepal. On
                                        its first floor, Lāykū Phalcā also displays immaculate woodcarvings on pillars,
                                        capitals, beams, cornices, and doors. Wooden statues of various tantric deities
                                        like the ten Mahāvidyās are placed at the centre of each capital (metha). The
                                        capitals contain carvings and images on the inner side as well. Furthermore,
                                        wooden images are installed on the beam (nināḥ) cobering each bay. The central
                                        bay among the 27 bays facing north is allocated for the sanctum that houses a
                                        śivaliṅga as the main deity. There used to be a two-storey high wooden tower
                                        (pula) on top of the sanctum, as to photos taken before the Great Earthquake
                                        from 1934. The tower (pula) placed above the sanctum was not reconstructed after
                                        the Phalcā's collapse in that earthquake. The 13-bayed section facing west also
                                        contains a sanctum at the centre accessible through an artistic door. A statue
                                        of Bhagavatī is enshrined in this sanctum. A second tower with a golden finial
                                        raises on top of this sanctum. A triśūla accompanies the finial.

                                        An inscription, dated 1683 CE (NS 803), posted on the wall of the Phalcā records
                                        its construction. It was constructed during the reign of King Jitāmitra Malla by
                                        his sons Ugra Malla and Bhupatindra Malla along with minister Duḥkhi Bhāgirāma
                                        (Gutschow 2011, p. 645). Impressed by the construction of the Phalcā and the
                                        shrines in it, the king had enforced a new system regarding irrigation canals to
                                        facilitate the farmers of Bhaktapur. A few bays and the pula on the eastern
                                        section of this phalcā can be seen in a painting by Henry Ambrose Oldfield from
                                        1854 CE. A portion of the 27-bayed section of the phalcā collapsed in the 2015
                                        earthquakes. It was reconstructed by the Department of Archaeology in 2020 CE.

                                        No guthi related to the Phalcā is (still) in existence. The daily worship at the
                                        shrines of Bhagavatī and śivaliṅga has also been discontinued. The upper floor
                                        of the 13-bay section of Lāykū Phalcā accommodates the office of the Department
                                        of Archaeology. Souvenir shops operated from the 27-bay section of the Lāykū
                                        Phalcā for decades in the past. They were removed from the Phalcā in the 1990s,
                                        stating the shops disturbed the ambiance of the palace square (local knowledge,

                                        The Sāḥgaḥ Mandaḥ Phalcā, located at the Sāgaḥ Ṭola in Kirtipur, is a
                                        very particular form of
                                        arcaded platform. For one, it is free-standing and square, with 16
                                        pillars on which the roof
                                        rests. Because of this, it is also called the Sorhakhuṭṭe
                                        “sixteen-legged” Phalcā. Moreover,
                                        because the square structure is said to contain nine maṇdaḥs, it is also
                                        known as Mandaḥ
                                        Phalcā. Another unique feature is that a water tank for drinking water -
                                        jaḥdhuṃ - is placed
                                        on the platform under the roof. Normally, such a tank could be found
                                        next to, but not in a
                                        building. Below the jaḥdhuṃ&#39;s outlet is a statue of Bhagīratha.
                                        A śivaliṅga is placed right
                                        behind the jaḥdhuṃhiti.

                                        Built in 1750 CE, the Sāḥgaḥ Mandaḥ Phalcā was constructed in memory of a
                                        deceased father from an Amatya family from the Dathu Ṭola. Probably, it
                                        collapsed during the Great Earthquake of 1934 CE. Since then, only a square
                                        plinth along with the śivaliṅga and the jaḥdhuṃ remained until, in 2008, the
                                        Department of Archaeology reconstructed the Phalcā under the supervision of

                                        Pilgrims used to take the road in front of the Phalcā for their pilgrimage to
                                        the Mātātīrtha on Mātātīrtha Aũśī (the new moon day of the dark fortnight of
                                        Vaiśākha). Until the late 1970s, local youths used to fill up the jaḥdhuṃ to
                                        provide drinking water to the pilgrims and also offered them pāṃti (a mixture of
                                        water and coarse brown sugar) on a particular day. This tradition ended in the
                                        1980s. The road also used to be a section of the trade route for the merchants
                                        of Citlāṅga (Chitlang) who travelled to Kathmandu and Patan via Kirtipur until
                                        the late Rāṇā period. Travellers and merchants presumably used to take shelter
                                        at this Phalcā and, In this context, quenched their thirst from the jaḥdhuṃ.

                                        The deity Vatsalā is considered one of the Tantric manifestations of
                                        goddess Parvatī. She is referred to as the clan deity of the Malla Kings
                                        in an inscription (now lost) in Bhaktapur. There are three temples
                                        dedicated to Vatsalā in the small perimeter of the Bhaktapur Darbar
                                        Square. Among them, this south-facing Temple in discussion is located in
                                        the centre of the square and is said to be built by King Bhūpatīndra
                                        Malla in 1699 CE, i.e., NS 820 (cp. Nepālikabhūpavaṃśāvalī 19.1-73).

                                        It stands out because of its artistic merits and is entirely constructed in
                                        stone, except for the pinnacle. The Temple’s outer structure rests on 12
                                        columns and has a three-level plinth. A bell supported by ornately
                                        designed columns and lintel rests on the lowest plinth and a pair of
                                        elephants and lions flank the entrance to the sanctum. Instead of a
                                        statue, a stone kalaśa as the representation of the Tantric deity
                                        Vatsalā is consecrated inside the sanctum. Most of the Vatsalā temples
                                        in the Kathmandu Valley have such aniconic stones to represent her.
                                        The local community believes that the deity was offered human sacrifice
                                        as part of the Tantric rites (Gutschow 2014, 33). The Devamālāvaṃśāvalī
                                        mentions that such rites were performed while consecrating goddess
                                        Vatsalā and establishing her shrine in Pashupati (cited from M. Thāpā VS
                                        2077, 183). Furthermore, residents of the area also believe that dogs
                                        start crying when the Temple bell is rung. In the Vatsalā Temple at
                                        Pashupati, dogs are said to be taken inside the sanctum during some
                                        rituals, and members of a certain guṭhī howl like wolves while kneeling
                                        and praying. There appear to be some connections between these rituals
                                        and strongly held local beliefs.
                                        The Temple’s structure, except its plinth, crumbled down in the 2015 CE
                                        earthquakes, and the Bhaktapur Municipality completed its renovation in
                                        2020 CE (VS 2077).

                                        It is very likely that this monument was
                                        previously a phalcā and later converted into a temple. Although the
                                        reason(s) behind such a conversion is not clear, it shows how the
                                        original structure and usages of cultural heritage sites change in due
                                        course of time. This sets a good example for why (in)tangible heritage
                                        should be preserved physically and digitally. Without proper
                                        documentation, the historical origins and transformations of such
                                        monument sites will remain unrecorded.

                                        in Junbesi (Dudhkunda, Solukhumbu) is considered
                                        to be the oldest Sherpa monastery. Junbesi was the first permanent
                                        settlement of the Sherpa people after they crossed over from Tibet in
                                        the early 16th century. The original monastery may date to that time.
                                        Other sources mention 1635 as the construction date. The monastery was
                                        damaged by an earthquake in the 17th century and partly destroyed by
                                        fire in 1914. Recent renovations include the replacement of the
                                        timber-framed entry porch with a cement and concrete portico. In 2007,
                                        the historic courtyard building was demolished and rebuilt as a stone
                                        and concrete structure covered with a corrugated metal roof.

                                        lore has it that the original statues escaped the fire by flying away to
                                        an undisclosed location. The upstairs room features a niche with a group
                                        of smaller statues representing Buddha Śākyamuni, Maitreya,
                                        Padmasambhava, Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana amongst others. The Gumbā

                                        cherished or even rejuvenated depends on the community/locality caring for
                                        the phalcā. Though partly endangered, the phalcā is not on its ‚way out’.
                                        Even today, communities invest in the construction of new pāṭīs.

                                        Sarāḥ Phalcā stands out for its remarkable pillar carvings. Located in
                                        Ikhachen (Ikhācheṃ), to the east of Tapahiti, the original name of the
                                        Phalcā is Sadāvarta Phalcā, most likely because it was constructed under the
                                        Sadāvarta Guṭhī of Śreṣṭhas from Ikhachen. No evidence could be found with
                                        which to date its initial construction. However, relying upon the wood
                                        carvings of the monument, it appears that at least the pillars were
                                        constructed during the late Malla period. Until the early 2000s, a library
                                        was kept in the Sarāḥ Phalcā, but it was closed down. The Phalcā is in
                                        severely endangered as it currently lacks a roof (covered by a large
                                        tarpaulin). This was removed and has not yet been replaced, meaning that the
                                        Phalcā is not appropriately protected from the heavy monsoon rains. In
                                        November 2019, several of its side walls were dismantled and rebuilt.

                                        Dāphā Phalcā, also called Cībhāḥ Phalcā, is located at the side of a busy
                                        road in the small town of Sunaguthi (or Sunakothi). It has finely carved
                                        pillars, decorative cornices, and a three-bay window. However, it is in a
                                        very neglected state and is missing its original roof. The roof currently
                                        consists of corrugated metal sheets supported by a make-shift structure of
                                        crudely shaped sticks. The window frames are damaged and sections of the
                                        carved frames are missing. This once free-standing Phalcā is further
                                        encroached upon by neighbouring private buildings. The floor and walls of
                                        the Phalcā are covered with cement plaster, which has led to the spread
                                        of damp. Two plywood door panels provide a way to the back room and have
                                        been inserted into poorly carved frames.

                                        The Phalcā is mainly related to the Caitya which stands in front of it.

                                        other ritual worships, people use the building as a resting place. The local

                                        temples’ sanctum to its current location.
                                        The rectilinear tower of the central temple is an interesting indicator of
                                        the creativity of medieval builders of western Nepal, who produced
                                        variations on a well-established type of architecture. Thus, the Lamjī
                                        Pañcadevala appears as an important historical site for the study of
                                        Nepalese architecture.

                                        out for the unique sculptural decorations found on vertical posts, with
                                        iconographies ranging from images of soldiers with rifles, planes,
                                        protectors or geometric shapes. Usually not older than fifty years, their
                                        cyclical construction requires large trees (a material more and more rare to

                                        suspension bridges are sometimes built next to them, traditional bridges
                                        often remain the preferred mode of crossing. One of the aims of the <a href="/"

                                        Chusyā Bāhāḥ, located in Jyāthā Ṭola, is one of the oldest bāhāḥs in
                                        Kathmandu, which still retains its original architecture. There is some
                                        debate about the Bāhāḥ's initial construction date. Karel Rijk van
                                        Kooij (1977, 39-82) is of the opinion that the iconography and stylistic
                                        details of the roof brackets are concurrent with drawings found in 11th
                                        century manuscripts.  Shantaram Balchandra Deo (1969, 10-11) has dated the
                                        struts to the 14th century

                                        The earliest dated sources related to the Bāhāḥ are two stone inscriptions
                                        issued during the reign of King Pratāpa Malla (r. 1641-74): A nicely
                                        preserved inscription from NS 788 (1668 CE) and a damaged inscription, most
                                        probably issued before NS 788 (1668 CE). The physical and palaeographical
                                        features of these inscriptions suggest that they were issued by the same
                                        person within a period of a few years.

                                        The NS 788 (1668 CE) inscription records the consecration of Guṇākara
                                        Mahāvihāra (Chusyā Bāhāḥ) ‘guṇākara mahāvihāra pratiṣṭhā saṃpūrṇa yāṅana’
                                        and the installation of Harāhara Lokeśvara sponsored by a person named
                                        Guṇajyoti (text: Guṇajoti) Vajrācārya together with his family members from
                                        Dhvākhā Bāhāḥ; the damaged inscription mentions the completion of the Bāhāḥ
                                        ‘thva vihara dayakā’.

                                        A third inscription installed inside the sanctum of the Bāhāḥ also by
                                        Guṇajyoti in NS 769 (1649 CE) records the renovation of a rest-house (capāḥ)
                                        constructed by his father Jñānajyoti (text: Jñānajoti) in honour of their
                                        clan deity, Maricī Devī. This indicates that there was a shrine or a pīṭha
                                        (abode) dedicated to Maricī Devī nearby. Chusyā Bāhāḥ is not mentioned
                                        in this inscription. If the expansive Mahāvihāra had existed here during
                                        this time, it would probably have been mentioned in the inscription which
                                        records the family tree of Guṇajyoti and the renovation of the capāḥ.

                                        Thus, it is likely that the broken inscription was issued after NS 769 (1649
                                        CE). We can then conclude that the Bāhāḥ must have been constructed sometime
                                        after NS 769 (1649 CE), and was consecrated (probably after its renovation)
                                        in NS 788 (1668 CE). One could even argue that Guṇajyoti converted the capāḥ
                                        built by his father into a bāhāḥ and named it Guṇākara Mahāvihāra (Chusyā
                                        Bāhāḥ) after him. Chusyā Bāhāḥ's saṅgha members believe that Guṇajyoti
                                        constructed the Bāhāḥ by spending his income generated from his trade in
                                        Tibet.
